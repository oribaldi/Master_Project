# Master's Project
Application of ESA, TF-IDF and LDA to Stackexchange data in three scenarios:

1) Global scenario: simulates a traditional centralized IR system.

2) Local scenario: simulates a distributed IR system, where users only have access to their local network.

3) Expert finding: simulates the search for users rather than resources to satisfy an information need.
